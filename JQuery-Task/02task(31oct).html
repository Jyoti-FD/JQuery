           <h1>BTS</h1>
           <br>
          <p>BTS was formed in 2012 after a series of auditions held by BigHit. The seven-member K-pop group -- which consists of RM, V, Jung <br>Kook, Jin, Suga, Jimin and J-Hope -- made its debut on June 13, 2013, with '2 Cool 4 Skool.' The septet developed a loyal worldwide <br>following called ARMY, with 'The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Pt. 2' -- which was released in November 2015 -- becoming BTS' first <br>album to debut on the Billboard 200, arriving at No. 171 on the Dec. 19, 2015-dated chart. When 'Love Yourself: Tear' was released in <br>May 2018, it debuted at No. 1 on the all-genre tally, making the album not only BTS' first Billboard 200 chart-topper, but also the <br>first K-pop album to reach the summit. Since then, BTS has garnered multiple Grammy nominations, including best pop duo/group <br>performance ("Dynamite," "Butter" and "My Universe") and best music video ("Yet to Come"). The group has also had multiple cross-genre <br>collaborations, including with Benny Blanco and Snoop Dogg ("Bad Decisions"), Halsey ("Boy With Luv"), Coldplay ("My <br>Universe"), Megan Thee Stallion ("Butter" remix), Nicki Minaj ("Idol") and many more.</p>

           <h1>You Never Walk Alone and Love Yourself</h1>
           <br>
           <p>In February 2017, BTS released the repackaged edition of Wings entitled You Never Walk Alone. The 700,000 pre-orders of it (an <br>increase from the 500,000 pre-orders of Wings) helped break the record for most albums sold in a month in South Korea, as it  <br>reached 1.49 million copies by the end of its first month. The lead single was "Spring Day" and it won Best Song of the Year at the <br>2017 Melon Music Awards. BTS's second world tour, 2017 BTS Live Trilogy Episode III: The Wings Tour, began in February. On the <br>tour, BTS played arenas in the US, such as New Jersey's Prudential Center and California's Honda Center. Tickets for the North <br>American leg sold out within hours and two shows were added. After completing the North American leg, BTS attended the 24th <br>Billboard Music Awards in May and won Top Social Artist, the first K-pop group to win a Billboard award.[82] BTS fans cast over 300 <br>million votes for the band and broke a six-year winning streak held by Justin Bieber, a performer with 100 million Twitter <br>followers. This caused the international media to focus on the ability of BTS's fandom to propel the group to such a victory.</p>

           <h1>Hiking</h1>
           <br>
           <p>If you have friends who hike, ask them to take you on a trek. Most people are happy to share their expertise, let you borrow gear <br> and introduce newbies to their favorite trails.

            If you don’t know any hikers, many cities and towns have hiking clubs that regularly plan outings.<br> You can find hiking classes, outings and events through REI Experiences. Online groups are also a great way to find hiking buddies.</p>
           <br>
           <p>As a beginner hiker, it can be tough to know how much food and water you need, A good general recommendation for how much to eat is <br>200–300 calories per hour. For water intake, about a half liter per hour of moderate activity in moderate temperatures is a good <br>starting place. These amounts depend heavily on several factors, such as the intensity of your hike, the weather, your age, your sweat <br>rate and your body type. As you gain more experience, you’ll get a better sense for just how much you need.</p>
